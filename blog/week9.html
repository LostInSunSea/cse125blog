			This week we spent a lot of time getting our game ready to demo this weekend at the Triton Gaming Expo, and, with perhaps another day of intergrating and polishing, we should be ready to go. Our levels are coming together, the gameplay code to interact with these levels is in place, our frame-rates are holding steady, switching animations (cleanly) is almost in, and we even managed to fix our audio issues!<br/>
                    <br>
                    We plan to fix up the game over the course of today and tomorrow to get it ready to demo, then work on expanding out new features (e.g. graphics) and more content (e.g. levels, models, sounds) over the bulk of the following week. <br/>

                        For this week, I had planned to do SSAO, Cloth Simulation and Animation Blending. Instead, I ended up pushing these tasks back once again, this time to work on optimizing and improving the game's graphics engine (although I did manage to sneak animation blending in). This turned out to be very handy, as not only does the game run a lot faster now, but I was able to discover some bugs that had cropped up in our lighting code. With these fixed and the increased performance, we can now have point light shadows on every light, which, combine with the correct lighting, looks really cool! There's still a bit to go to further optimize it (e.g. Austin may look into frustum culling to speed up general rendering and dynamic point light shadows, like the ones on the players), but it's at a pretty good place for now (well, until I add some more graphics features to slow it back down :) ).<br/>
                        <br>
                        Goals for next week are to finally get to these features I want to do :)! First on the list is SSAO and updating the forward renderer for foliage, followed by Cloth Simulation & Multiple Environment Map Generation & Rendering (might enlist someone else too on these ones to spread out the work). Morale is pretty high, as the lighting looks really good now, and I'm excited with the new levels we're rolling out and demoing this weekend!

                        The goals for this week were business as usual: server integration and helping out with other tasks. We implemented some cool features  regarding gameplay mechanics. This included have statues that mimic the singing functionality of the players, and even move towards the player, as well as adding in checkpoint functionality for player deaths.
                        <br>
                        Server integration proved to be tricky as always, as we again overhauled some functionalities. We added in capability for multiple events, both to be assigned to a gameobject and to the various switches we have. We also updated the way we serialize player output: previously we had custom serialization in place, but we migrated the serialization to the new method introduced last week. This helped build in some abstraction for the statue and players when it came to functionality and serialization. Lastly, the Audio engine was overhauled this week, so we simply tweaked the portions that were needed to maintain communication and functionality with the server/client.
                        <br>
                        One aspect not tested was the gameplay mechanic for moving platforms: theoretically they are in the game, but we did not test it fully due to other outstanding tasks as well my inability to render anything other than a teapot (Not a graphics person! :p). Also, while server/client communication is working well, we need to extensively test multiplayer. Our main focus has been getting the game to work in single player mode for client/server, and multiplayer is something that is in the back of our minds.
                        <br>
                        Going into next week,it is starting to be crunch time. Our tasks will most likely again be focused on ensuring everything works with backend while helping anyone else with tasks they need.
                        <br>
                        Morale is good, and anticipating great things into this next week.

                        What I did:
                        I fixed up some of the menu UI parts; put in an options menu, made a logo, and title name. Helped Stephen with him completing the full “components-to-unity-to-gamescene” pipeline. Now game play scenes can be pretty quickly built, which he’s been doing (shoutout, congrats, thanks, to all the work Stephen did this weekend).
                        By the time you read this, I should also have put in the new animations john gave us into our animation graphs.
<br>
                        My unaccomplished goals:
                        Help Stephen somehow. He’s been doing a lot.
                        <br>

                        My new hopes and dreams:
                        Touch up the UI and menus some more. Stephen expressed some interest in being able to support multiple games (and add a lobby system) so the game can be showcased more easily. This might take a while.
                        If Alex doesnt get to it, I want to put in turn rate.

                        Morale:
                        Better. Roughish personal issues, happens.

                        My goals for this week were to implement the view frustum culling as well as debug the new sound engine rewrite for Ara and Justin
                        <br>
                        I'm almost done with the creation of the view frustum culling as well as some bug fixes here and there for the sound. The HTML5 Audio API has proven to be incredibly frustrating but I think I can get things done.
                        <br>
                        This week my goals are to get culling finished and work out a few kinks in the Audio. As well as helping out with the last of the game play code needed to run the game. I starting to feel the stress with coming finals but still feeling good overall.

                        Like last week, my goals for this week were scene building and modeling.  I got the characters more animated and worked with Alex to make sure we got the animations we need for the game.  In so doing, I was able to fix a few rigging bugs in some of the characters.  I built another one of the major “set pieces” for the game and continued helping build the level.
                        <br>
                        As I said last week, as we are approaching the the end of the quarter, there will be more pressure to build out the level and create these set pieces.  I’ve now created two set pieces and will need to make one to three others (I’m fairly certain).  The animation graphs should make the animations look really smooth (since the animations themselves look pretty nice).
                        <br>
                        This week, my goals are the same (like the last two weeks).  I’d like to see a more set pieces in the game by next week as well as all of the characters instead of all the same.  I’d also like to see more multiplayer in the level as we push to the final demo.  My morale is high and I’m getting excited to see where the final game is going.

                        The goals for the past week were to work towards having our first level built out for the game. We hoped to develop any gameplay elements necessary to make it happen. A couple off the top of my head include platforms and checkpoints. In addition, the goal of incorporating whatever is being worked on by everyone else into networking and the server is always present.
                        <br>
                        For this past week we continued to work on server integration with all the features coming in from the various branches. Specifically, we merged in some camera fixes as well as the rewritten audio engine. In regards to gameplay, we implemented singing statues, moving statues, checkpoints, and moving platforms. All have been integrated with the server.
                        <br>
                        There were a couple issues that we came across with testing the platforms. Due to our lack of knowledge of the rendering portion of game we were not able to test with the correct colliders. We just simulated trying to stand on a teapot while we elevated it. For the most part it worked but we need to tweak some things with how bouncy the collisions are.
                        <br>
                        For next week we are waiting for the pipeline to come into play especially the linking of components in unity and importing into our game. I feel some stuff would mess up and we should tackle and resolve this as soon as possible. We will continue and work on integration and keep everything working together.
                        <br>
                        My morale is good, the game is coming together and starting to look really great. We are almost there.

                    <p>
                        This week I wanted to get working on the next set piece and get the coinciding AI for the first set piece and maybe the second.
                        <br>
                        I got another set piece in this week with most of the gameplay figured out as well. The main idea behind it is to introduce the idea of set pieces. So the puzzles are relatively straightforward and don’t require a large amount of cooperation between the players (in fact, it should be completable with only two people!). I still want to add in all the detail so the space is less barren, but I like how it’s coming along.
                        <br>
                        The AI is doing alright. I’ve added in some more behavior, like the abilities to damage players and to chase after a player when they’re within a certain radius. I’ve put off some of the details as I think that the animation will be very important going forward to figure out and integrate with the behavior trees.
                        <br>
                        The biggest feature I accomplished this week is the semi-completion of the gameplay pipeline. We’re finally able to create the levels in Unity, attached with our components, and get it imported into our engine. Singing now interacts with switches to open doors! However, the reason why I said semi-completion is that not all the gameplay code has been flushed out, most specifically raycasting (which Ara and Justin are currently getting to work better).
