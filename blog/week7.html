                        My goals for this week were to start revamping the sound engine and try and get it fixed on firefox as well as start working on more sound design. I continued to create more sounds for the game as well as starting to get them integrated into the demo to make sure its ready. Stephen recently presented me with a list of suggested sounds in order to let me get started on the more difficult time consuming sounds to make.
                        <br>
                        Due to the time crunch with finals and the end of the quarter on the horizon, it's really starting to get hurried. I'm feeling pretty good however and with grading out of the way I can start to contribute more on the gameplay aspect of the game and not just debugging and sound design.
                        <br>
                        This week my goals are to be able to get all the sounds for the game in by the weekend and get at least some temporary sounds in for everything so that we have a proper experience ready when we need to demo it and get testers. My morale is high and I'm starting to get really excited with how the game is progressing

                        My goals for this week were scene building and modeling.  Like last week, I was able to make a number of assets for a level, and continued working on building the level with Stephen.  I’ve started creating a number of assets for more detailing as well as larger “set pieces” for some of the bigger parts of the game.
                        <br>
                        As we are approaching the last few weeks, there will be more pressure to build out the level.  Right now, I’m just working on creating models as need be and using them as needed.  As we start to figure out the layout of the level, I can go to work detailing it for the final game.
                        <br>
                        This week, my goals are the same (and probably will be more-or-less the same for the rest of the quarter).  I’d like to see a one or two “set pieces” in the game by next week.  My morale is high and I’m getting excited to see where the final game is going.

                And so Rand and Mat finally arrive at Camelyn. They seek out an inn Thom told them about earlier, and found that the innkeeper is sympathetic to their plight. Rand also meets Loial, an Ogier. The Ogier are reclusive creatures who live in the stedding. In the past, they have created many structures that are still intact after many generations. Loial decides he want to join Rand in his journey. While in Camelyn, Rand discovers there is great political tension between people who support the current regime, and those who dislike the Aes Sedai’s influence over the queen. Camelyn is crowded with people who want to see the captured false Dragon. To give context, a king of a previous age was called Dragon, and his use of magic drove him mad and he destroyed the world. And currently, a man named Logain claimed to be the next incarnation of Dragon and mustered up an army for his plans of conquest. And to add some intrigue, the Dark One has been appearing in Rand’s, Mat’s and Perrin’s dreams and claims the Aes Sedai have actually been the ones manipulating Logain and other previous false Dragons. The day the captured false Dragon was being paraded through the streets, Rand was trying to get a better view, climbed up a wall, and accidently fell into the royal palace, where he is found by the Daughter-Heir, Elayne, and her brother. Someone in the palace calls the guard and he is sent to be questioned by the queen, and thanks to some support from Elayne, Rand is set free and goes about his business.<br><br>
                This part actually felt out of place. We have been following Rand and Mat as they struggle with all they have just to travel to Camelyn, with the hopes that their friends are still alive. And suddenly he falls into the palace and meets the princess, who seems to have at least a positive image of him, like a scene out of a cliche fantasy story. It was a major change of pace that I wasn’t prepared for.<br><br>
                Meanwhile, with Perrin and Egwene, I got the escape scene I was looking forward to. Moiraine, Lan, and Nynaeve track Perrin down and discover Perrin and Egwene have been captured. Nynaeve unties the horses and Moiraine calls down thunder to create chaos, while Lan frees the two. The scene was a little underwhelming, but I guess it got the job done. They head to Camelyn and meet up with Rand and Mat.<br><br>
                After they meet, Moiraine announces that there has been a change in plans and needs to head to the Blight, where there are humans fighting off the Dark One’s minions, and find the Eye of the World, so that some large turning point in history will be forced to happen there. And because the dark forces are surrounding Camelyn, they need to find another way out. Moiraine requests Loial that they use the Ways, a sort of separate dimension that the Ogier used in the past to move between places quickly. However, the Ways were build by male Aes Sedai in the past, and thus became tainted as time went on, so it’s super spooky right now. Oh, and at some point Moiraine helped cure Mat from the evil dagger possessing him, but not completely.<br><br>
                And thus our party entered the Ways, with the guidance of Loial, and made their way to Fal Dara, a fort on the borderlands of the Blight. The Ways are corrupted, and they also discover the Dark One’s forces have also been using the ways to move around. Anyway, our party arrives at Fal Dara mostly safely and make plans to travel into the Blight and find the Eye of the World.<br><br>
                Many of the parts I read this week seems to be just progressing the story with nothing too interesting happening. I can’t really blame the author, he needed to wrap up all the separate stories and bring them all together for the final conclusion. But it also feels a little strange to bring up so many new characters who feel like they will contribute greatly to the story like Loial and Elayne. Well in Loial’s case, his purpose has been fulfilled by guiding the party through the Ways. But they also mention how Thom is mostly likely not dead. I am nearing the end of the book, and it feels like all these characters probably won’t have their story fully fleshed out until the sequels. Maybe it’s just how I read books, I try to understand how each character contributes to the overall story. And thus, I like predicting what purpose different characters have in the story. So I have an expectation that certain characters will have a big impact later on. But I guess this is how authors get people to read the sequels.<br><br>
